# OOP Solution Bundle
This is a bundle of solutions for tasks from University.

To build the project, please, use the C++ version 20 or higher. CLang compilier is recommended.

To turn into test mode, set `Test` to `yes`, `y`, `1`, or `true` in `CMakeLists.txt`. If you want to run `main.cpp`, make `Test` equal to `no`, `n`, `0`, or `false`.
